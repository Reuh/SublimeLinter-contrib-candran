================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-contrib-candran.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-contrib-candran)

This linter plugin for [SublimeLinter](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter) provides an interface to [canc -parse](https://github.com/Reuh/candran). It will be used with files that have the “Candran” syntax.

## Installation
SublimeLinter must be installed in order to use this plugin. 

Please use [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io) to install the linter plugin.

Before installing this plugin, you must ensure that `canc` (which is included with [Candran](https://github.com/Reuh/candran)) is installed on your system.

In order for `canc` to be executed by SublimeLinter, you must ensure that its path is available to SublimeLinter. The docs cover [troubleshooting PATH configuration](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html#finding-a-linter-executable).
